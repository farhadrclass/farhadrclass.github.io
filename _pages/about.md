Welcome to my website! I'm Farhad Rahbarnia, a Ph.D. student at Polytechnique Montréal. I'm delighted to have you here and share a bit about myself and my academic journey.


## Academic Background

I pursued my undergraduate studies at the University of Guelph, where I completed a degree in Computer Engineering. During my time there, I developed a strong passion for programming, algorithms, and data science. This laid the foundation for my further academic pursuits and research interests.

I completed my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, from 2017 to 2020. My Master's thesis titled **"Semi-deterministic Finite Interval Estimation of Linear System Dynamics and Output Trajectory"** allowed me to explore the complex world of linear system dynamics and develop innovative methods for accurate estimation.

## Ph.D. Research

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at Polytechnique Montréal, where I'm actively engaged in cutting-edge research. My doctoral research revolves around **"Connecting Deep Learning Models with Optimization Solvers"**. I am fascinated by the potential of deep learning in various fields, and I aim to explore novel methods to improve the optimization process and the performance of deep learning models.

## Teaching Experience

In addition to my research, I'm also passionate about teaching and mentoring. I have had the privilege of being an instructor and course designer at McGill University, where I taught courses on **Data Structures and Algorithms**, **Programming Techniques**, **Object-Oriented Programming**, and more. Guiding and empowering students to achieve their academic goals is incredibly rewarding for me.

## Awards & Achievements

Throughout my academic journey, I have been honored to receive several awards and recognition for my academic achievements. Notably, I was awarded the prestigious **NSERC PGSD** scholarship, which provides financial support to high-caliber students like me to pursue their research aspirations. I have also been part of exciting competitions, including the **Ontario Engineering Competition**, where I showcased my problem-solving skills and innovative thinking.
